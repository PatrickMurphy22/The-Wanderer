# Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my abilities in HTML and CSS. 

It's responsive on Desktop, Tablets and Mobiles and works on multiple browsers. 

The purpose of this website is to provide everyone and anyone the opportunity to travel with a community of like minded individuals. It's for everyone.

Memebers of the community will be able to see what locations are being ventured to over the next 3 months. They can sign up to newsletters to see what dates the community will be at each location
