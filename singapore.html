                    <p> Officially the Republic of Singapore. Singapore is a sovereign island country and city-state in maritime Southeast Asia.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Singapore embarked on a modernisation programme beginning in the late 1960s through the 1970s that focused on establishing a manufacturing industry, developing large public housing estates, and investing heavily in public education and infrastructure.
                        By the 1990s, the country had become one of the world's most prosperous nations, with a highly developed free market economy and strong international trading links. It now has the highest per capita gross domestic product in Asia,
                        which is 7th in the world, and it is ranked 9th on the UN Human Development Index.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Lonely Planet named Singapore its top country destination for 2015. An island known as a little red dot on the world map, Singapore has less than 5.5 million people.
                        <br>
